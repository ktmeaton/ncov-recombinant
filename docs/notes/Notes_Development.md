# Development

## Workflow

1. Error catching in `plot` and `report` when no designated sequences are present.
1. Added new script `parents.py` to summarize recombinant sequences by parent.
1. Added new plots and report section for parents summary.
1. Make `plot` and `report` more dynamic with regards to plots.

## Output

1. Output new file `parents.tsv` to summarize recombinant sequences by parent.
1. Order the colors/legend of the stacked bar `plots` by number of sequences.
1. Include lineage and cluster id in filepaths of largest plots and tables.

## Params

1. Add new optional param `max_placements` to rule `linelist`.

## Programs

1. Upgrade UShER to v0.5.4 (possible was in ver prior?)
