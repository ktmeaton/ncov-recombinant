## What is a Recombinant?

A recombinant lineage is defined as a group of sequences with a unique combination of:

- Lineage assignment (ex. `XM`)
- Parental clades (ex. `Omicron/21K`,`Omicron/21L`)
- Parental lineages (ex. `BA.1.1`,`BA.2.12.1`)
- Breakpoint intervals (ex. `17411:21617`)

### Designated Recombinants

Designated recombinants from [pango-designation](https://github.com/cov-lineages/pango-designation) can be identified by a lineage assignment that starts with `X` (ex. `XA`).

### Novel Recombinants

Novel recombinants (i.e. undesignated) can be identified by a lineage assignment that _does not_ start with `X*` (ex. BA.1.1) _or_ with a lineage assignment that contains `-like` (ex. `XM-like`).
