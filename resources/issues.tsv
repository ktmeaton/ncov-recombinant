498	proposed498	monitor	currently too small, watch for future developments	 Austria	Omicron/21L,Omicron/21K,Omicron/21L	17410:18163,24130:24503	We identified two sequences from different patients in the province of Burgenland (Austria) with a mutation pattern indicating a recombination event between BA.2 and BA.1.1, with two breakpoints. Spike and 3’ end of the ORF1b, appear to be of BA.1 origin, while the remaining 5’ and 3’ legs appear to be of BA.2 origin (see Fig. 1,2). Given the frequencies of variant defining mutations observed in the sequencing reads are consistently close to 1 (> 0.97), and that we only find sporadic mutations at low frequencies in the reads (< 0.07), a contamination/coinfection scenario appears unlikely. Examining the phylogenic neighborhood with UShER discloses two Spanish (EPI_ISL_10716853, EPI_ISL_10716861) and one English (EPI_ISL_11037709) sequence with similar irregular mutation pattern (Figure 3) although the BA.1.1 insertions are larger according to sc2rf.

Additionally, two XM, XJ and XE samples were added to sc2rf output:;The samples may share the same breakpoint and the Brazilian sample seems to harbor a BA.1.14 profile at ORF1A. We will monitor if more samples will emerge.	Potential recombinant BA.1/BA.2 circulating in Brazil, Malaysia, Denmark and India	2022-04-16T23:34:09Z	2022-04-18T10:13:51Z	2022-04-18T10:13:51Z

485	proposed485			 Austria			In this context I am wondering if this could be either a recombinant between BA.1 and BA.2 with multiple breakpoints or an “early” rarely sampled branch of BA.2? I am also thinking about possible contamination but in such case, I would expect at least a few ambiguities (non-ACGTN characters) instead of none?
