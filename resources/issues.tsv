Spike and 3’ end of the ORF1b, appear to be of BA.1 origin, while the remaining 5’ and 3’ legs appear to be of BA.2 origin (see Fig. 1,2). Given the frequencies of variant defining mutations observed in the sequencing reads are consistently close to 1 (> 0.97), and that we only find sporadic mutations at low frequencies in the reads (< 0.07), a contamination/coinfection scenario appears unlikely. Examining the phylogenic neighborhood with UShER discloses two Spanish (EPI_ISL_10716853, EPI_ISL_10716861) and one English (EPI_ISL_11037709) sequence with similar irregular mutation pattern (Figure 3) although the BA.1.1 insertions are larger according to sc2rf.
